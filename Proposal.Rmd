## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

###Section 1 - Introduction


We are investigating what makes NBA players successful in various seasons. We
are all NBA fans and looking into statistics about the NBA will allow us to 
have a better understanding for the game and make us more informative fans. 
Basketball statistics are fairly new and it will be interesting to discover if
our perceived notions of certain players match the statistical data. We want
to look at if defensive or offensive efficiency affects winning percentage the
most.
In particular, we want to test the following hypothesis

Better defensive players have a better winning percentage in the playoffs and 
regular season.

Players who score the most do not have the highest winning percentage.

Players who have the most offensive possessions win more games.

We wish to explore the NBA-Raptor data set. Raptor is a player efficiency rating 
system.This data set has tracked multiple team and player analysis over a six 
year period. Each observation is an NBA player with variables about their 
statistics. It has variables such as players points per game, team winning 
percentage, average team possessions per game, and many more. The player data
is stats from every NBA games since 2014. Raptor was made by Fivethirtyeight. 



###Section 3 - Glimpse of data

```{r section-3}

Place your data in a /data folder of the repo you create. Later on you will include the codebook in the README of the data folder.
